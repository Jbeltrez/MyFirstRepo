Hello World 

Some extra text

some extra test text

changes that occur during the second branch creation which is just 
another new branch. this branch was created on GH desktop. 

also adding some text here to test out the "git add -u" command 
which theoritcally is only supposed to add modified and deleted files 
only not new files. Therefore, this file being a modified file should 
be staged while the index.html file that was just added shouldnt 
be staged. I will now try the command.
